let strategy = StrategyComposer::new()
    .compose_strategy(
        AdvancedStrategyType::BullishDragonSpread,
        &strategy_params
    )?;

// Calculate win probability
let win_prob = strategy_optimizer.calculate_win_probability(&strategy, &market_data)?;

// Execute strategy with risk management
let execution = strategy_executor.execute_with_risk_management(strategy, position_size)?;
```
